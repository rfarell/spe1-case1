SPE1 Case 1 - Sample Data Information
=====================================

The full simulation outputs are generated when you run the pipeline.
These include:

1. HDF5 file with complete grid timeseries (patched/SPE1CASE1_PATCHED.h5)
   - Size: ~57 KB (compressed)
   - Contains: 123 timesteps × 10×10×3 grid
   - Parameters: PRESSURE, SWAT, SGAS, RS

2. Parquet file with summary data (patched/SPE1CASE1_PATCHED.parquet)
   - Size: ~9 KB
   - Contains: Field production rates and selected cell data

To generate these files:
1. Place SPE1CASE1.DATA in data/ directory
2. Run the simulation pipeline as described in README.md

The figures/ directory contains visualizations of the dataset that
demonstrate what the simulation produces.
